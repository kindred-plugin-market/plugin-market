#!/usr/bin/env node
// Vendored by bench-quality-cli (feature: bench-guards).
//
// Refuses to run when a file is staged *and* has further unstaged edits:
// formatters/fixers below would otherwise re-stage changes the author never
// reviewed (and their unstaged work would be swallowed by the commit).
//
// Two ways it is used:
//   1. standalone pre-commit command (`partial-staging`), so the failure is
//      reported even when no fixer would have run;
//   2. chained in front of every command that modifies the worktree/staging
//      area (`node scripts/quality/guard-partial-staging.mjs && node ... --fix`),
//      which makes the ordering independent of lefthook's parallel scheduling.
//
// Exported for tests; also runnable as a script. Uses -z throughout so file
// names with spaces, newlines or CJK characters are handled correctly.
